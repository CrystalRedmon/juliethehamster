    About Julie
</h2>
<p> Julie is a our Syrian hamster. We brought her home in 2022. She has become part of our
    family. We wanted a dog but this little ball of cheeks has stolen our hearts. This is our story about Julie and her
    adventures living in the lively Redmon household.
</p>

    <h2>Before Julie</h2>
    <p> Gwens bday, the original setup
        Gwen, the youngest of the family, wanted a pet. She wanted a pet for a long time. She specifically wanted a
        corgi. Unfortunately her family's home was too small for a dog, including a corgi. Eventually, Gwen began
        watching videos about hamsters. Gwen learned a lot from Victoria Rachel. Gwen decided to ask her mom for a
        hamster. Gwen was about to turn 10 years old and she figured 10 was a big birthday so she should get a big gift.
        Mom was reluctant but Gwen displayed her knowledge to her mom. Mom caved. She agreed to buy a hamster for Gwen's
        10th birthday!
        <br>
        <br>
        Soon Gwen and Mom began putting together plans for the hammy house. They went back and forth between purchasing
        a used aquarium and a homemade container home. They settled on the container home. Ready to get it together,
        Gwen and Mom went to Home Depot to get their materials. Dad also helped to put the hammy house together. They
        did run into some difficulties but in the end, they were able to put it together and it was a labor of love.

<h2>Julie's Arrival</h2>
<p>The Redmon crew made the trip to Petsmart a week before Gwen's birthday. They looked at Chinese Dwarf hamsters, robo
    hamsters, and the fancy bear hamster. They decided to get a friendly looking brown syrian hamster (Gwen had wanted a
    hamster that she could name Peanut Butter). The hamster was placed inside a cardboard carrying case and was handed
    over to Gwen. Gwen was officially a hammy mommy.
</p>



<h2>The First Few Weeks</h2>
<p>Gwen knew that Julie would need to get comfortable before she could pick Julie up. More than two weeks had passed and
    still no one had held Julie. One memorable night while Dad was asleep Julie escaped her hammy home. Julie had found
    an opening Mom had missed when constructing the lid of the homemade container cage. Mom and the kids were all
    downstairs looking at Julie as she sat on top of the grated lid. Brandon swooped Julie up so Mom could figure out
    what to do next. Brandon tried to give Julie to Gwen but Gwen still wasnâ€™t completely comfortable. They had to put
    Julie in her cardboard carrying case. Mom found several items, including a heavy picture frame and a chess game box,
    to cover the openings in the lid. Within the next few days Julie had a brandnew home.
    <br>
    <br>
    Mom and Dad had gone to a pet store in South Minneapolis and were able to find an aquarium on sale. They got home
    and set it up. Julie seemed super happy. The aquarium was much bigger than the original house and they had to add
    additional bedding.
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
    After a month Julie had finally settled in to her new home. Gwen was able to finally hold her. Mom held Julie. Even
    Phoenix tried to hold Julie but was always super freaked out.
